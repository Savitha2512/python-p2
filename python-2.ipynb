It is theseventh-largest country by area; themost populous countryas of June 1, 2023;[26][27]and from the time of its independence in 1947, the world\\'s most populous democracy.[28][29][30]Bounded by theIndian Oceanon the south, theArabian Seaon the southwest, and theBay of Bengalon the southeast, it shares land borders withPakistanto the west;[j]China,Nepal, andBhutanto the north; andBangladeshandMyanmarto the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity ofSri Lankaand theMaldives; itsAndaman and Nicobar Islandsshare a maritime border withThailand, Myanmar, andIndonesia.Modern humansarrived on theIndian subcontinentfrom Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[31][32][33]Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in humangenetic diversity.[34]Settled lifeemerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of theIndusriver basin9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into theIndus Valley Civilisationof the third millennium BCE.[35]By 1200BCE, anarchaic formofSanskrit, anIndo-European language, haddiffusedinto India from the northwest.[36][37]Its evidence today is found in the hymns of theRigveda. Preserved by anoral traditionthat wasresolutely vigilant, theRigvedarecords the dawning ofHinduismin India.[38]TheDravidian languagesof India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[39]By 400BCE,stratificationandexclusionbycastehad emerged within Hinduism,[40]andBuddhismandJainismhad arisen, proclaimingsocial ordersunlinked to heredity.[41]Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knitMauryaandGupta Empiresbased in theGanges Basin.[42]Their collectiveerawas suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[43]but also marked by the declining status of women,[44]and the incorporation ofuntouchabilityinto an organised system of belief.[k][45]InSouth India, theMiddle kingdomsexported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms ofSoutheast Asia.[46]In the early medieval era,Christianity,Islam,Judaism, andZoroastrianismbecame established on India\\'s southern and western coasts.[47]Muslim armies fromCentral Asiaintermittently overran India\\'s northern plains,[48]eventually founding theDelhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitannetworks of medieval Islam.[49]In the 15th century, theVijayanagara Empirecreated a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[50]In thePunjab,Sikhismemerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[51]TheMughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[52]leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[l][53]Gradually expandingrule of the British East India Companyfollowed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating itssovereignty.[54]British Crown rulebegan in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[55][56]buttechnological changeswere introduced, and modern ideas of education and the public life took root.[57]A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[58][59]In 1947 the British Indian Empire waspartitionedinto two independentdominions,[60][61][62][63]a Hindu-majorityDominion of Indiaand a Muslim-majorityDominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[64]India has been afederal republicsince 1950, governed through a democraticparliamentary system. It is apluralistic,multilingualandmulti-ethnic society. India\\'s population grew from 361 million in 1951 to almost 1.4 billion in 2022.[65]During the same time, its nominalper capita incomeincreased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[66]India has become afast-growingmajor economyand a hub forinformation technology services, with an expanding middle class.[67]It hasa space programmewhich includes several planned or completedextraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[68]India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[69]India is anuclear-weapon state, which ranks high inmilitary expenditure. It has disputes overKashmirwith its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[70]Among the socio-economic challenges India faces aregender inequality,child malnutrition,[71]and rising levels ofair pollution.[72]India\\'s land ismegadiverse, with fourbiodiversity hotspots.[73]Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[74]India\\'s wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance inIndia\\'s culture,[75]is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, inprotected habitats.EtymologyAccording to theOxford English Dictionary(third edition 2009), the name \"India\" is derived from theClassical LatinIndia, a reference toSouth Asiaand an uncertain region to its east; and in turn derived successively from:Hellenistic GreekIndia(Ἰνδία);ancient GreekIndos(Ἰνδός);Old PersianHindush, an eastern province of theAchaemenid Empire; and ultimately itscognate, theSanskritSindhu, or \"river,\" specifically theIndus Riverand, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[76][77]Theancient Greeksreferred to the Indians asIndoi(Ἰνδοί), which translates as \"The people of the Indus\".[78]The termBharat(Bhārat;pronounced[ˈbʱaːɾət](listen)), mentioned in bothIndian epic poetryand theConstitution of India,[79][80]is used in its variations bymany Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical nameBharatavarsha, which applied originally toNorth India,[81][82]Bharatgained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[79][83]Hindustan([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn](listen)) is aMiddle Persianname for India that became popular by the 13th century,[84]and was used widely since the era ofMughal Empire. The meaning ofHindustanhas varied, referring to a region encompassing present-day northern India andPakistanor to India in its near entirety.[79][83][85]HistoryMain articles:History of IndiaandHistory of the Republic of IndiaAncient IndiaManuscript illustration,c.1650, of the Sanskrit epicRamayana, composed in story-telling fashionc.400BCE– c.300CE[86]By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, orHomo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[31][32][33]The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[31]After 6500BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared inMehrgarhand other sites inBalochistan, Pakistan.[87]These gradually developed into theIndus Valley Civilisation,[88][87]the first urban culture in South Asia,[89]which flourished during 2500–1900BCEin Pakistan and western India.[90]Centred around cities such asMohenjo-daro,Harappa,Dholavira, andKalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[89]During the period 2000–500BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from theChalcolithiccultures to theIron Ageones.[91]TheVedas, the oldest scriptures associated withHinduism,[92]were composed during this period,[93]and historians have analysed these to posit aVedic culturein thePunjab regionand the upperGangetic Plain.[91]Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves ofIndo-Aryan migrationinto the subcontinent from the north-west.[92]Thecaste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[94]On theDeccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[91]InSouth India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number ofmegalithicmonuments dating from this period,[95]as well as by nearby traces ofagriculture,irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[95]Cave 26 of the rock-cutAjanta CavesIn the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as themahajanapadas.[96][97]The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions.Jainismcame into prominence during the life of its exemplar,Mahavira.[98]Buddhism, based on the teachings ofGautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[99][100][101]In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held uprenunciationas an ideal,[102]and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom ofMagadhahad annexed or reduced other states to emerge as theMauryan Empire.[103]The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[104][105]The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as forAshoka\\'s renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhistdhamma.[106][107]TheSangam literatureof theTamil languagereveals that, between 200BCEand 200CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by theCheras, theCholas, and thePandyas, dynasties thattraded extensively with the Roman Empireand withWestandSoutheast Asia.[108][109]In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.[110][103]By the 4th and 5th centuries, theGupta Empirehad created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[111][112]Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[113]This renewal was reflected in a flowering ofsculptureandarchitecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[112]Classical Sanskrit literatureflowered as well, andIndian science,astronomy,medicine, andmathematicsmade significant advances.[112]Medieval IndiaBrihadeshwara temple,Thanjavur, completed in 1010CETheQutub Minar, 73\\xa0m (240\\xa0ft) tall, completed by theSultan of Delhi,IltutmishThe Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[114]WhenHarshaofKannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by theChalukyaruler of the Deccan.[115]When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by thePalaking ofBengal.[115]When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by thePallavasfrom farther south, who in turn were opposed by thePandyasand theCholasfrom still farther south.[115]No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[114]During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[116]The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[116]In the 6th and 7th centuries, the firstdevotional hymnswere created in the Tamil language.[117]They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of allmodern languages of the subcontinent.[117]Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[118]Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[118]By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-dayMyanmar,Thailand,Laos,Brunei,Cambodia,Vietnam,Philippines,Malaysia, andIndonesia.[119]Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[119]After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, usingswift-horsecavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia\\'s north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the IslamicDelhi Sultanatein 1206.[120]The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[121][122]By repeatedly repulsingMongol raidersin the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries ofmigrationof fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[123][124]The sultanate\\'s raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenousVijayanagara Empire.[125]Embracing a strongShaivitetradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[126]and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[125]Early modern IndiaIn the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[127]fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[128]The resultingMughal Empiredid not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[129][130]and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[131]leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[132]Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially underAkbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[131]The Mughal state\\'s economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[133]and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[134]caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[132]The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India\\'s economic expansion,[132]resulting in greater patronage ofpainting, literary forms, textiles, andarchitecture.[135]Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as theMarathas, theRajputs, and theSikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[136]Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[136]As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[137]A distant view of theTaj Mahalfrom theAgra FortA twomohurCompany gold coin, issued in 1835, theobverseinscribed \"William IV, King\"By the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including theEnglish East India Company, had established coastal outposts.[138][139]The East India Company\\'s control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over theBengalregion by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[140][138][141][142]Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[143]India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying theBritish Empirewith raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India\\'s colonial period.[138]By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform, and culture.[144]Modern IndiaMain article:History of the Republic of IndiaHistorians consider India\\'s modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 ofLord Dalhousieas Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction inEurope.[145][146][147][148]However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off theIndian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[149][150]Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and thedirect administration of Indiaby the British government. Proclaiming aunitary stateand a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[151][152]In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of theIndian National Congressin 1885.[153][154][155][156]The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[157]There was an increase in the number of large-scalefamines,[158]and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[159]There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.[160]The railway network provided critical famine relief,[161]notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[161]and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[160]1909 map of the British Indian EmpireJawaharlal Nehrusharing a light moment withMahatma Gandhi, Mumbai, 6 July 1946After World War I, in which approximatelyone million Indians served,[162]a new period began. It was marked byBritish reformsbut alsorepressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of anonviolentmovement of non-co-operation, of whichMahatma Gandhiwould become the leader and enduring symbol.[163]During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[164]The next decade was beset with crises:Indian participation in World War\\xa0II, the Congress\\'s final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by thepartition of Indiainto two states: India and Pakistan.[165]Vital to India\\'s self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic.[166]Per theLondon Declaration, India retained its membership of theCommonwealth, becoming the first republic within it.[167]Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1990s, has created a large urban middle class, transformed India intoone of the world\\'s fastest-growing economies,[168]and increased its geopolitical clout. Indian films, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[169]Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and urban;[169]byreligiousandcaste-related violence;[170]byMaoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies;[171]and byseparatism in Jammu and Kashmirandin Northeast India.[172]It has unresolved territorial disputes withChina[173]and withPakistan.[173]India\\'s sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world\\'s newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved.[174]GeographyMain article:Geography of IndiaIndia accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop theIndian tectonic plate, a part of theIndo-Australian Plate.[175]India\\'s defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinentGondwana, began a north-eastwarddriftcaused byseafloor spreadingto its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[175]Simultaneously, the vastTethyanoceanic crust, to its northeast, began tosubductunder theEurasian Plate.[175]These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth\\'smantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indiancontinental crusteventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift theHimalayas.[175]Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shapedtroughthat rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[176]and now constitutes theIndo-Gangetic Plain.[177]The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancientAravalli range, which extends from theDelhi Ridgein a southwesterly direction. To the west lies theThar Desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis.[178][179][180]TheTungabhadra, with rocky outcrops, flows into the peninsularKrishna river.[181]Fishing boats lashed together in atidal creekinAnjarlevillage, MaharashtraThe remaining Indian Plate survives aspeninsular India, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as theSatpuraandVindhyaranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-richChota Nagpur Plateauin Jharkhand in the east.[182]To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, theDeccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as theWesternandEastern Ghats;[183]the plateau contains the country\\'s oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6° 44′ and 35° 30′ north latitude[m]and 68° 7′ and 97° 25′ east longitude.[184]India\\'s coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700\\xa0mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400\\xa0mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300\\xa0mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains.[185]According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46%mudflatsor marshy shores.[185]Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include theGangesand theBrahmaputra, both of which drain into theBay of Bengal.[186]Important tributaries of the Ganges include theYamunaand theKosi; the latter\\'s extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes.[187][188]Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include theGodavari, theMahanadi, theKaveri, and theKrishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal;[189]and theNarmadaand theTapti, which drain into theArabian Sea.[190]Coastal features include the marshyRann of Kutchof western India and the alluvialSundarbansdelta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh.[191]India has twoarchipelagos: theLakshadweep,coral atollsoff India\\'s south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in theAndaman Sea.[192]Indian climateis strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and wintermonsoons.[193]The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asiankatabatic windsfrom blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.[194][195]The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India\\'s rainfall.[193]Four major climatic groupings predominate in India:tropical wet,tropical dry,subtropical humid, andmontane.[196]Temperatures in India have risen by 0.7\\xa0°C (1.3\\xa0°F) between 1901 and 2018.[197]Climate change in Indiais often thought to be the cause. Theretreat of Himalayan glaciershas adversely affected theflow rateof the major Himalayan rivers, including theGangesand theBrahmaputra.[198]According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century.[199]BiodiversityMain articles:Forestry in IndiaandWildlife of IndiaIndia has the majority of the world\\'s wild tigers, approximately 3,170 in 2022.[200]AChital(Axis axis) stag attempts to browse in theNagarhole National Parkin a region covered by amoderately dense[n]forest.India is amegadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries which display highbiological diversityand contain many species exclusivelyindigenous, orendemic, to them.[201]India is ahabitatfor 8.6% of allmammalspecies, 13.7% ofbirdspecies, 7.9% ofreptilespecies, 6% ofamphibianspecies, 12.2% offishspecies, and 6.0% of allflowering plantspecies.[202][203]Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic.[204]India also contains four of the world\\'s 34biodiversity hotspots,[73]or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism.[o][205]According to official statistics, India\\'sforest coveris 713,789\\xa0km2(275,595\\xa0sq\\xa0mi), which is 21.71% of the country\\'s total land area.[74]It can be subdivided further into broad categories ofcanopy density, or the proportion of the area of a forest covered by itstree canopy.[206]Very dense forest, whosecanopy densityis greater than 70%, occupies 3.02% of India\\'s land area.[206][207]It predominates in thetropical moist forestof theAndaman Islands, theWestern Ghats, andNortheast India.Moderately dense forest, whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India\\'s land area.[206][207]It predominates in thetemperate coniferous forestof theHimalayas, the moist deciduoussalforest of eastern India, and the dry deciduousteakforest of central and southern India.[208]Open forest, whose canopy density is between 10% and 40%, occupies 9.26% of India\\'s land area.[206][207]India has two natural zones ofthorn forest, one in theDeccan Plateau, immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation, its features no longer visible.[209]Among the Indian subcontinent\\'s notable indigenous trees are theastringentAzadirachta indica, orneem, which is widely used in rural Indianherbal medicine,[210]and the luxuriantFicus religiosa, orpeepul,[211]which is displayed on the ancient seals ofMohenjo-daro,[212]and under whichthe Buddhais recorded in thePali canonto have sought enlightenment.[213]Many Indian species have descended from those ofGondwana, the southernsupercontinentfrom which India separated more than 100 million years ago.[214]India\\'s subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species. However,volcanismandclimatic changeslater caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.[215]Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through twozoogeographicalpasses flanking the Himalayas.[216]This had the effect of lowering endemism among India\\'s mammals, which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians.[203]Among endemics are the vulnerable[217]hooded leaf monkey[218]and the threatened[219]Beddome\\'s toad[219][220]of the Western Ghats.The last three Asiatic cheetahs (on record) in India were shot dead in 1948 in Surguja district, Madhya Pradesh, Central India by Maharajah Ramanuj Pratap Singh Deo.  The young males, all from the same litter, were sitting together when they were shot at night.India contains 172IUCN-designatedthreatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms.[221]These include the endangeredBengal tigerand theGanges river dolphin.Critically endangeredspecies include: thegharial, acrocodilian; thegreat Indian bustard; and theIndian white-rumped vulture, which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion ofdiclofenac-treated cattle.[222]Before they were extensively utilized for agriculture and cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by theAsiatic cheetah; the blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab, is now severely endangered in India, and the cheetah is extinct.[223]The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system ofnational parksandprotected areas, first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted theWildlife Protection Act[224]andProject Tigerto safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988.[225]India hostsmore than five hundred wildlife sanctuariesandeighteenbiosphere reserves,[226]four of which are part of theWorld Network of Biosphere Reserves;seventy-five wetlandsare registered under theRamsar Convention.[227]Politics and governmentPoliticsMain article:Politics of IndiaAs part ofJanadesh 2007, 25,000 pro-land reformlandlesspeople inMadhya Pradeshlisten toRajagopal P.

Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,[235]as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-partycoalition governmentsat the centre.[236]In the Republic of India\\'s first three general elections, in1951,1957, and1962, thePandit Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru\\'s death in 1964,Lal Bahadur Shastribriefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Nehru\\'s daughterIndira Gandhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in1967and1971. Following public discontent with thestate of emergencyshe declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in1977; the then-newJanata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over two years. There were two prime ministers during this period;Morarji DesaiandCharan Singh. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi wasassassinated; she was succeeded by her sonRajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general electionslater that year. The Congress was voted out again in1989when aNational Frontcoalition, led by the newly formedJanata Dalin alliance with theLeft Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived, lasting just under two years. There were two prime ministers during this period;V.P. SinghandChandra Shekhar.[237]Elections were held again in1991; no party won an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form aminority governmentled byP. V. Narasimha Rao.[238]US presidentBarack Obamaaddresses themembersof theParliament of IndiainNew Delhiin November 2010.A two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two comparatively long-lastingUnited Frontcoalitions, which depended on external support. There were two prime ministers during this period;H.D. Deve GowdaandI.K. Gujral. In1998, the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, theNational Democratic Alliance(NDA). Led byAtal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-Congress,coalition governmentto complete a five-year term.[239]Again in the2004 Indian general elections, no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: theUnited Progressive Alliance(UPA). It had the support ofleft-leaningparties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the2009 general electionwith increased numbers, and it no longer required external support fromIndia\\'s communist parties.[240]That year,Manmohan Singhbecame the first prime minister sinceJawaharlal Nehruin1957and1962to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term.[241]In the2014 general election, the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties.[242]In the2019 general election, the BJP was victorious again.

Three of these wars were fought over thedisputed territory of Kashmir, while the third, the 1971 war, followed from India\\'s support for theindependence of Bangladesh.[273]In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country: apeace-keeping operationinSri Lankabetween 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a1988 coup d\\'état attemptin the Maldives. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economicties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.[274]Aside from ongoing itsspecial relationship with Russia,[275]India has wide-rangingdefence relations with IsraelandFrance.

The number of people living in urban areas grew by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001.[367]Yet, in 2001, over 70% still lived in rural areas.[368][369]The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to 31.16% in the 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991.[370]According to the 2011 census, there are 53million-plus urban agglomerations in India; among themMumbai,Delhi,Kolkata,Chennai,Bangalore,HyderabadandAhmedabad, in decreasing order by population.[371]The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males.[372]The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011.

The\"Pashupati\" seal, excavated inMohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928–29, is the best known.[383][384]After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.[384][385]Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religioussculpturein durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north IndiaMauryan artis the first imperial movement.[386][387][388]In the first millennium CE,Buddhist artspread with Indian religions toCentral,EastandSouth-East Asia, the last also greatly influenced byHindu art.[389]Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy thanancient Greek sculpturebut showing smoothly-flowing forms expressingprana(\"breath\" or life-force).[390][391]This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with theArdhanarishvaraform of Shiva andParvati.[392][393]Most of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhiststupassuch asSanchi,SarnathandAmaravati,[394]or is rock-cutreliefsat sites such asAjanta,KarlaandEllora. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later.[395][396]In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities.[397]Gupta art, at its peakc.300CE– c.500CE, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at theElephanta Caves.[398][399]Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic afterc.800CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues.[400]But in the South, under thePallavaandChola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had asustained period of great achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva asNatarajahave become an iconic symbol of India.[401][402]Ancient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in theAjanta Cavesare by far the most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times.[403][404]Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. No doubt the style of these was used in larger paintings.[405]The Persian-derivedDeccan painting, starting just before theMughal miniature, between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits, and the recording of princely pleasures and wars.[406][407]The style spread to Hindu courts, especiallyamong the Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such asNihâl ChandandNainsukh.[408][409]As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied byCompany paintingby Indian artists with considerable Western influence.[410][411]In the 19th century, cheapKalighat paintingsof gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urbanfolk artfromCalcutta, which later saw theBengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement inmodern Indian painting.[412][413]Bhutesvara Yakshis, Buddhist reliefs fromMathura, 2nd centuryCEGuptaterracottarelief,KrishnaKilling theHorse Demon Keshi, 5th centuryElephanta Caves, triple-bust(trimurti) of Shiva, 18 feet (5.5\\xa0m) tall,c.550Chola bronzeofShivaasNataraja(\"Lord of Dance\"),Tamil Nadu, 10th or 11th centuryJahangirReceivesPrince KhurramatAjmeron His Return from theMewarCampaign, Balchand,c.1635Krishna Fluting to the Milkmaids,Kangra painting, 1775–1785ArchitectureMain article:Architecture of IndiaThe Taj Mahal from across theYamuna rivershowing two outlying red sandstone buildings, a mosque on the right (west) and ajawab(response) thought to have been built for architectural balanceMuch ofIndian architecture, including theTaj Mahal, other works ofIndo-Islamic Mughal architecture,  andSouth Indian architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles.[414]Vernacular architectureis also regional in its flavours.Vastu shastra, literally \"science of construction\" or \"architecture\" and ascribed toMamuni Mayan,[415]explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings;[416]it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs.[417]As applied inHindu temple architecture, it is influenced by theShilpa Shastras, a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is theVastu-Purusha mandala, a square that embodied the \"absolute\".[418]The Taj Mahal, built inAgrabetween 1631 and 1648 by orders ofMughal emperorShah Jahanin memory of his wife, has been described in theUNESCO World Heritage Listas \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world\\'s heritage\".[419]Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew onIndo-Islamic architecture.[420]LiteratureMain article:Indian literatureThe earliest literature in India, composed between 1500BCEand 1200CE, was in theSanskritlanguage.[421]Major works ofSanskrit literatureinclude theRigveda(c.1500BCE– c.1200BCE), theepics:Mahābhārata(c.400BCE– c.400CE) and theRamayana(c.300BCEand later);Abhijñānaśākuntalam(The Recognition of Śakuntalā, and other dramas ofKālidāsa(c.5th centuryCE) andMahākāvyapoetry.[422][423][424]InTamil literature, theSangam literature(c.600BCE– c.300BCE) consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work.[425][426][427][428]From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India\\'s literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence ofdevotional poetslikeKabīr,Tulsīdās, andGuru Nānak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.[429]In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by theworksof the Bengali poet, author and philosopherRabindranath Tagore,[430]who was a recipient of theNobel Prize in Literature.Performing arts and mediaMain articles:Music of India,Dance in India,Cinema of India, andTelevision in IndiaIndia\\'sNational Academy of Performance Artshas recognised eight Indian dance styles to beclassical.

Since then, satellite channels have increasingly shaped the popular culture of Indian society.[441]Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of 2012[update]there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462\\xa0million with satellite or cable connections compared to other forms of mass media such as the press (350\\xa0million), radio (156\\xa0million) or internet (37\\xa0million).[442]SocietyMuslims offernamazat a mosque inSrinagar, Jammu and Kashmir.Traditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. TheIndian caste systemembodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands ofendogamoushereditary groups, often termed asjātis, or \"castes\".[443]India abolisheduntouchabilityin 1950 with the adoption of theconstitutionand has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives.Family valuesare important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generationalpatrilinealjoint familieshave been the norm in India, thoughnuclear familiesare becoming common in urban areas.[444]An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, havetheir marriages arrangedby their parents or other family elders.[445]Marriage is thought to be for life,[445]and the divorce rate is extremely low,[446]with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce.[447]Child marriagesare common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age.[448]Female infanticide in India, and latelyfemale foeticide, have created skewed gender ratios; the number ofmissing womenin the country quadrupled from 15 million to 63 million in the 50-year period ending in 2014, faster than the population growth during the same period, and constituting 20 percent of India\\'s female electorate.[449]According to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care.[450]Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains commonplace in India, the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society.[451]The payment ofdowry, althoughillegal, remains widespread across class lines.[452]Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly frombride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.[453]ManyIndian festivalsare religious in origin.

In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. In 1921 the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In 1891 they were 5%, 9% and 1%,[456][457]According to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages. Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity limited its growth.[458]The education system of India is the world\\'s second-largest.[459]India has over 900 universities, 40,000 colleges[460]and 1.5 million schools.[461]In India\\'s higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved underaffirmative actionpolicies for the historically disadvantaged.

It is also commonly worn with an Indianblouse, orcholi, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari\\'s end—passing over the shoulder—serving to cover the midriff and obscure the upper body\\'s contours.[464]For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, thedhoti, has served as a lower-body garment.[465]Women (from left to right) inchuridarsandkameez(with back to the camera), jeans and sweater, and pinkShalwar kameezThe use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by theDelhi sultanate(ca 1300 CE) and then continued by theMughal Empire(ca 1525 CE).[466]Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are: theshalwarsandpyjamas, both styles of trousers, and the tunicskurtaandkameez.[466]In southern India, the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use.[466]Shalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated around the waist.[467]The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on thebias, in which case they are calledchuridars. When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic,[468]its side seams left open below the waist-line.[469]Thekurtais traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such aschikan; and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer\\'s knees.[470]In the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions.[471]The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans.[471]In white-collar office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round.[471]For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle- and upper classes often wearbandgala, or shortNehru jackets, with pants, with the groom and hisgroomsmensportingsherwanisand churidars.[471]The dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwovenkhadiallowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions,[472]is seldom seen in the cities.[471]CuisineMain article:Indian cuisineSouth Indian vegetarianthali, or platterRailwaymutton curryfromOdishaThe foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.[473]The cooked cereal could be steamed rice;chapati, a thin unleavened bread made from wheat flour, or occasionally cornmeal, and griddle-cooked dry;[474]theidli, a steamed breakfast cake, ordosa, a griddled pancake, both leavened and made from a batter of rice- andgrammeal.[475]The savoury dishes might includelentils,pulsesand vegetables commonly spiced withgingerandgarlic, but also with a combination of spices that may includecoriander,cumin,turmeric,cinnamon,cardamonand others as informed by culinary conventions.[473]They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients might be mixed during the process of cooking.[476]A platter, orthali, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments, which are often served in small bowls. The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner. This is accomplished by mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or folding, wrapping, scooping or dipping—such as chapati and cooked vegetables or lentils.[473]A tandoor chef in theTurkman Gate,Old Delhi, makes Khameeriroti(a Muslim-influenced style ofleavened bread).[477]India has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents.[478]The appearance ofahimsa, or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in Indian history, especiallyUpanishadic Hinduism,BuddhismandJainism, is thought to have contributed to the predominance of vegetarianism among a large segment of India\\'s Hindu population, especially in southern India, Gujarat, theHindi-speaking belt of north-central India, as well as among Jains.[478]Although meat is eaten widely in India,  the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low.[479]Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption.[480]The most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during theMughal Empire. Dishes such as thepilaf,[481]developed in theAbbasid caliphate,[482]and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its northwest.[483]To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic, almonds, and spices began to be added in India.[483]Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot sealed tightly, and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today become the Indianbiryani,[483]a feature of festive dining in many parts of India.[484]In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance ofPunjabi cuisine. The popularity oftandoori chicken—cooked in thetandooroven, which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but which is originally fromCentral Asia—dates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced by the 1947partition of India.[478]Sports and recreationMain article:Sport in IndiaGirls playhopscotchinJaora, Madhya Pradesh.

Its elite called itself Arya (pure) and distinguished themselves sharply from others. Aryans led kin groups organized as nomadic horse-herding tribes. Their ritual texts are called Vedas, composed in Sanskrit.Vedic Sanskritis recorded only in hymns that were part of Vedic rituals to Aryan gods. To be Aryan apparently meant to belong to the elite among pastoral tribes. Texts that record Aryan culture are not precisely datable, but they seem to begin around 1200 BCE with four collections of Vedic hymns (Rg, Sama, Yajur, and Artharva).\"(d)Dyson 2018, pp.14–15, \"Although the collapse of the Indus valley civilization is no longer believed to have been due to an \\'Aryan invasion\\' it is widely thought that, at roughly the same time, or perhaps a few centuries later, new Indo-Aryan-speaking people and influences began to enter the subcontinent from the north-west. Detailed evidence is lacking. Nevertheless, a predecessor of the language that would eventually be called Sanskrit was probably introduced into the north-west sometime between 3,900 and 3,000 years ago. This language was related to one then spoken in eastern Iran; and both of these languages belonged to the Indo-European language family. ... It seems likely that various small-scale migrations were involved in the gradual introduction of the predecessor language and associated cultural characteristics. However, there may not have been a tight relationship between movements of people on the one hand, and changes in language and culture on the other. Moreover, the process whereby a dynamic new force gradually arose—a people with a distinct ideology who eventually seem to have referred to themselves as \\'Arya\\'—was certainly two-way. That is, it involved a blending of new features which came from outside with other features—probably including some surviving Harappan influences—that were already present. Anyhow, it would be quite a few centuries before Sanskrit was written down. And the hymns and stories of the Arya people—especially the Vedas and the later Mahabharata and Ramayana epics—are poor guides as to historical events. Of course, the emerging Arya were to have a huge impact on the history of the subcontinent. Nevertheless, little is known about their early presence.\";(e)Robb 2011, pp.46–, \"The expansion of Aryan culture is supposed to have begun around 1500 BCE.

They heard about it on the radio, from relations and friends, by reading newspapers and, later, through government pamphlets.  Among a population of almost four hundred million, where the vast majority live in the countryside, ploughing the land as landless peasants or sharecroppers, it is hardly surprising that many thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, did not hear the new for many weeks afterwards. For some, the butchery and forced relocation of the summer months of 1947 may hve been the first that they knew about the creation of the two new states rising from the fragmentary and terminally weakened British empire in India^(a)Copland 2001, pp.\\xa071–78;(b)Metcalf & Metcalf 2006, p.\\xa0222.^Dyson 2018, pp.219, 262^Fisher 2018, p.8^Metcalf & Metcalf 2012, pp.265–266^Metcalf & Metcalf 2012, p.266^Dyson 2018, p.216^(a)\"Kashmir, region Indian subcontinent\",Encyclopaedia Britannica,archivedfrom the original on 13 August 2019, retrieved15 August2019,Kashmir, region of the northwestern Indian subcontinent... has been the subject of dispute between India and Pakistan since the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947.;(b)Pletcher, Kenneth,\"Aksai Chin, Plateau Region, Asia\",Encyclopaedia Britannica,archivedfrom the original on 2 April 2019, retrieved16 August2019,Aksai Chin, Chinese (Pinyin) Aksayqin, portion of the Kashmir region, ... constitutes nearly all the territory of the Chinese-administered sector of Kashmir that is claimed by India;(c)Bosworth, C.

       " \"Politically, by the rd century BCE, the kingdom ofMagadhahad annexed or reduced other states to emerge as theMauryan Empire.The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as forAshoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhistdhamma.TheSangam literatureof theTamil languagereveals that, between BCEand CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by theCheras, theCholas, and thePandyas, dynasties thattraded extensively with the Roman Empireand withWestandSoutheast Asia.In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.By the th and th centuries, theGupta Empirehad created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.This renewal was reflected in a flowering ofsculptureandarchitecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.Classical Sanskrit literatureflowered as well, andIndian science,astronomy,medicine, andmathematicsmade significant advances.Medieval IndiaBrihadeshwara temple,Thanjavur, completed in CETheQutub Minar, \\xa0m (\\xa0ft) tall, completed by theSultan of Delhi,IltutmishThe Indian early medieval age, from  to CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.WhenHarshaofKannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from  to CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by theChalukyaruler of the Deccan.When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by thePalaking ofBengal.When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by thePallavasfrom farther south, who in turn were opposed by thePandyasand theCholasfrom still farther south.No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.In the th and th centuries, the firstdevotional hymnswere created in the Tamil language.They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of allmodern languages of the subcontinent.Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.By the th and th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-dayMyanmar,Thailand,Laos,Brunei,Cambodia,Vietnam,Philippines,Malaysia, andIndonesia.Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.After the th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, usingswift-horsecavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the IslamicDelhi Sultanatein .The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India.\",\n",
       " \"Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.By repeatedly repulsingMongol raidersin the th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries ofmigrationof fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenousVijayanagara Empire.Embracing a strongShaivitetradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.Early modern IndiaIn the early th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.The resultingMughal Empiredid not stamp out the local societies it came to rule.\",\n",
       " 'Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practicesand diverse and inclusive ruling elites,leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially underAkbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.The Mughal state\\'s economic policies, deriving most revenues from agricultureand mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the th century was a factor in India\\'s economic expansion,resulting in greater patronage ofpainting, literary forms, textiles, andarchitecture.Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as theMarathas, theRajputs, and theSikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.A distant view of theTaj Mahalfrom theAgra FortA twomohurCompany gold coin, issued in , theobverseinscribed \"William IV, King\"By the early th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including theEnglish East India Company, had established coastal outposts.The East India Company\\'s control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over theBengalregion by  and sideline the other European companies.Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of India by the s.India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying theBritish Empirewith raw materials.',\n",
